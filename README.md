A Contact Management Web Application built using React that allows users to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on contacts in a simple and user-friendly interface.
This project is designed to manage contact information such as name, phone number. It demonstrates React fundamentals, API integration, and component-based architecture.
The application interacts with a backend (JSON Server / REST API) to fetch and persist contact data.
